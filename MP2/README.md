## some details
Root finding methods are algorithm for finding zeroes, also called "roots", of continuous functions.
Can be used to solve any equation of continuous functions. 
However, most root-finding algorithms do not guarantee that they will find all roots of a function, and if such an algorithm does not find any root, that does not necessarily mean that no root exists.
