# Numerical Differentiation and Integration
Python implementations of various methods for numerical differentiation and numerical integration, essential techniques in numerical analysis for approximating derivatives and integrals of functions.

## Polynomial Approximation and Interpolation
Polynomial approximation and interpolation techniques, including:
  Basic Polynomial Approximation: A method for approximating functions using polynomial expressions.
  Lagrange Interpolation: A form of polynomial interpolation that constructs a polynomial passing through a given set of points.
  Piecewise Lagrange Interpolation: A technique that applies Lagrange interpolation to different segments of the data, improving accuracy for larger datasets.

## Numerical Differentiation
Involves estimating the derivative of a function based on discrete data points. The key methods covered include:
  Finite Differences: A technique used to approximate derivatives by taking differences between function values at specific points.
  Interpolation Methods: Approaches that use interpolation to estimate derivatives by constructing a function that approximates the data and then differentiating the interpolating function.

## Numerical Integration
Approximates the integral of a function using discrete data points. Methods covered include:
  Quadrature Rules: Techniques for approximating definite integrals by evaluating the function at specific points.
  Newton-Cotes Formulas: A family of quadrature rules that use equally spaced points for integration, including methods like the trapezoidal rule and Simpsonâ€™s rule.
  Gaussian Quadrature: A highly accurate integration method that uses optimally chosen points and weights to approximate the integral.

## Numerical Solutions to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
Solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using numerical methods, focusing on:
Runge-Kutta Methods (4th and 3rd order): Popular iterative methods used for solving ODEs with high accuracy by approximating solutions at intermediate points within each step.
