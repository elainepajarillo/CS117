# Numerical Analysis Linear and Nonlinear Systems
Techniques that are used to attempt to find approximate solutions of problems rather than the exact ones.
We need approximations because we either cannot solve the procedure analytically or because the analytical method is intractable 
(an example is solving a set of a thousand simultaneous linear equations for a thousand unknowns).

## Linear Systems 
Methods to find the approximate solutions of linear problems:

Direct Methods: Triangular Systems

LU Factorization 

Pivoting: Partial and Complete Pivoting

### Iterative Methods: 
Jacobi Method

Gauss-Seidel Method

Over-Relaxation Methods


## Nonlinear Systems
Methods to find the approximate solutions of nonlinear problems:

Newton Method

Nonlinear Gauss-Seidel Methods

Fixed-Point Method
